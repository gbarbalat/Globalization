# Globalization.

This is an ecological analysis using the GBD database. 
This aims to relate DALYs for mental and substance use disorders, age standardised per countries, to globalization index.
This takes into account confounding factors such as an index of development or inequalities.
An important confounder is of course baseline outcome measure which we chose for the year 1990.
Initial analysis were done with age and sex as moderating factors and taking into account temporality.
We then chose to analyse Age standardize data and focus on year 2019, countries with higher data quality, and both sex to simplify the analysis.
